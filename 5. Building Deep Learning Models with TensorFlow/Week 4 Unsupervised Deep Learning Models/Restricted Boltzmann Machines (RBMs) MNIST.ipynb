It can automatically extract <b>meaningful</b> features from a given input.\n","\n","<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n","RBM is a 2 layer neural network. Simply, RBM takes the inputs and translates those into a set of binary values that represents them in the hidden layer. Then, these numbers can be translated back to reconstruct the inputs. Through several forward and backward passes, the RBM will be trained, and a trained RBM can reveal which features are the most important ones when detecting patterns.   \n","\n","<h4>What are the applications of an RBM?</h4>\n","RBM is useful for <a href='http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hinton/absps/netflixICML.pdf?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDL0120ENSkillsNetwork20629446-2021-01-01'>  Collaborative Filtering</a>, dimensionality reduction, classification, regression, feature learning, topic modeling and even <b>Deep Belief Networks</b>.\n","\n","<h4>Is RBM a generative or Discriminative model?</h4>\n","RBM is a generative model. Let me explain it by first, see what is different between discriminative and generative models: \n","\n","<b>Discriminative:</b> Consider a classification problem where we want to learn to distinguish between Sedan cars (y = 1) and SUV cars (y = 0), based on some features of cars. Given a training set, an algorithm like logistic regression tries to find a straight line, or <i>decision boundary</i>, that separates the suv and sedan.\n","\n","<b>Generative:</b> looking at cars, we can build a model of what Sedan cars look like. Then, looking at SUVs, we can build a separate model of what SUV cars look like. Finally, to classify a new car, we can match the new car against the Sedan model, and match it against the SUV model, to see whether the new car looks more like the SUV or Sedan.\n","\n","Generative Models specify a probability distribution over a dataset of input vectors. We can carry out both supervised and unsupervised tasks with generative models:\n","\n","<ul>\n","    <li>In an unsupervised task, we try to form a model for $P(x)$, where $P$ is the probability given $x$ as an input vector.</li>\n","    <li>In the supervised task, we first form a model for $P(x|y)$, where $P$ is the probability of $x$ given $y$(the label for $x$). For example, if $y = 0$ indicates that a car is an SUV, and $y = 1$ indicates that a car is a sedan, then $p(x|y = 0)$ models the distribution of SUV features, and $p(x|y = 1)$ models the distribution of sedan features. If we manage to find $P(x|y)$ and $P(y)$, then we can use <b>Bayes rule</b> to estimate $P(y|x)$, because:   \n","        $$p(y|x) = \\frac{p(x|y)p(y)}{p(x)}$$</li>\n","</ul>\n","Now the question is, can we build a generative model, and then use it to create synthetic data by directly sampling from the modeled probability distributions?
