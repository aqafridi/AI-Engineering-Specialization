In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization), because it is relatively rare to have a dataset of sufficient size. Instead, it is common to pretrain a ConvNet on a very large dataset in the lab, then use this Network to train your model. We will use the Convolutional Network as a feature generator, only training the output layer.  In general, 100-200 images will give you a good starting point, and it only takes about half an hour.  Usually, the more images you add, the better your results, but it takes longer and the rate of improvement will decrease.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["-   Import Libraries and Define Auxiliary Functions\n","-   Create Dataset Object\n","-   Load Model and Train\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["* * *\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Import Libraries and Define Auxiliary Functions\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#! conda install -c pytorch torchvision\n","#! pip install skillsnetwork tqdm\n","#!pip install  skillsnetwork"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Libraries for OS and Cloud\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","import uuid\n","import shutil\n","import json\n","from botocore.client import Config\n","import ibm_boto3\n","import copy\n","from datetime import datetime\n","from skillsnetwork import cvstudio "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Libraries for Data Processing and Visualization\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from PIL import Image\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import math\n","from matplotlib.pyplot import imshow\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","from ipywidgets import IntProgress\n","import time "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Deep Learning Libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch\n","import torchvision.models as models\n","from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader,random_split\n","from torch.optim import lr_scheduler\n","from torchvision import transforms\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","torch.manual_seed(0)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Plot train cost and validation accuracy:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def plot_stuff(COST,ACC):    \n","    fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()\n","    color = 'tab:red'\n","    ax1.plot(COST, color = color)\n","    ax1.set_xlabel('Iteration', color = color)\n","    ax1.set_ylabel('total loss', color = color)\n","    ax1.tick_params(axis = 'y', color = color)\n","    \n","    ax2 = ax1.twinx()  \n","    color = 'tab:blue'\n","    ax2.set_ylabel('accuracy', color = color)  # we already handled the x-label with ax1\n","    ax2.plot(ACC, color = color)\n","    ax2.tick_params(axis = 'y', color = color)\n","    fig.tight_layout()  # otherwise the right y-label is slightly clipped\n","    \n","    plt.show()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Plot the transformed image:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def imshow_(inp, title=None):\n","    \"\"\"Imshow for Tensor.\"\"\"\n","    inp = inp .permute(1, 2, 0).numpy() \n","    print(inp.shape)\n","    mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])\n","    std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])\n","    inp = std * inp + mean\n","    inp = np.clip(inp, 0, 1)\n","\n","    plt.imshow(inp)\n","    if title is not None:\n","        plt.title(title)\n","    plt.pause(0.001)  \n","    plt.show()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Compare the prediction and actual value:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def result(model,x,y):\n","    #x,y=sample\n","    z=model(x.unsqueeze_(0))\n","    _,yhat=torch.max(z.data, 1)\n","    \n","    if yhat.item()!=y:\n","        text=\"predicted: {} actual: {}\".format(str(yhat.item()),y)\n","        print(text)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Define our device as the first visible cuda device if we have CUDA available:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["device = torch.device(\"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n","print(\"the device type is\", device)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Load Data\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["In this section we will preprocess our dataset by changing the shape of the image, converting to tensor and normalizing the image channels.
